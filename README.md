The Messenger Chat Client is a Python application that combines a login screen and a chat client. Users can log in using their credentials, create new accounts, and then connect to chat servers to send and receive messages.

## Features

- User login and account creation with password hashing for security.
- Connect to chat servers using IP and Port or select from saved server addresses.
- Real-time chat functionality with message sending and receiving.
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5.

## Installation

Clone this repository or download the source code.

git clone https://github.com/TheMime3/ClientServerRelations.git

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:

## Starting the Client

Navigate to the .exe and double click to run

The login screen will appear. You can either log in with an existing account or create a new one.

After a successful login, you'll be directed to the chat client interface. You can connect to chat servers using saved addresses or add custom server addresses.

Start sending and receiving messages in real-time on the chat client interface.
